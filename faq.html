                      The MetaBeat platform is built around NFT creations,
                      participants, and rewards related to an artist's
                      intellectual property (IP).

                    <p>
                      As NFT creations and users grow on the platform,
                      partnerships between creators or artists and fans are
                      strengthened through positive symbiotic experiences
                      facilitated by the MetaBeat ecosystem that reflect the
                      values ​​and contributions of users in the MetaBeat

                      Participants will have a special experience of being

                      business models: Drops, Mingle, and Shout-out, and further
