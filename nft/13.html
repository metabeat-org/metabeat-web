          Super rookie's prelude Rookie boy group 'ONEUS' 1st Mini Album [LIGHT
          US] released!<br />
          <br />
          RBW's first boy group ONEUS' debut album [LIGHT US] will be released
          on January 9th.<br />
          ONEUS, which consists of 6 members, RAVN, Seoho, Leedo, Keonhee,
          Hwanwoong, and Xion, has the meaning of 'we (US) made by gathering the
          power of each fan (ONE)'. It also contains the meaning of 'in the end,
          ordinary people come together to create one world'.<br />
          <br />
          ONEUS, ambitiously prepared by RBW, who has led the success of
          talented musicians, is an artist-type performance group that not only
          looks good, but also has the ability to write lyrics, compose,
          produce, and create choreography. Fans have already been watching
          active activities such as numerous performances, entertainment and
          busking through the project called 'I will debut' for about 1 year and
          10 months. And now, the first album [LIGHT US] has been released,
          announcing a splendid prelude that marks the end of fans' waiting.<br />
          <br />
          This mini-album [LIGHT US] is an album with the theme of “shining on
          us”, which means the music created by “ONEUS, born with the light
          people shine on”, and the meaning of the title song “Valkyrie” at the
          same time. It is also an album that contains the meaning of lighting
          up the light of darkness.<br />
          <br />
          The title song 'Valkyrie' is a dance song that starts with an
          impressive guitar riff and develops into a heavy sound. It has an
          impressive sound with hip-hop elements added.<br />
          Also, 'Valkyrie' is a song that contains the symbolic meaning of
          'light' and the fantasy element of finding 'Valkyrie' to light up us
          in darkness. The theme of 'Valkyrie', known as the existence that
          takes the Naga warriors to Valhalla Palace, and the ambiguous
          expression of 'lighting up' add to the perfection of this song.<br />
          <br />
          The mini-album [LIGHT US] contains a total of 7 songs including the
          title song, and the intro trailer 'Intro: LIGHT US', which was
          released in advance and gave freshness to the public with individual
          original performance videos and music, is a visual It is a song that
          implicitly expresses the mini-album [LIGHT US] by expressing the in
          effect through music.<br />
          <br />
          And the synth-pop 'Crooked', which has a colorful synth sound theme
          and an addictive melody, is a song that has been shown many times in
          the 'I will debut' project and has already received a lot of love.<br />
          <br />
          ONEUS' first ballad song 'Red Thread' is a song with a motif of a
          Chinese folk tale in which an invisible red thread connects a
          relationship.<br />
          <br />
          The fifth b-side song, 'EYE CONTACT', expresses the thrill of the
          moment when you are attracted to it with strong attraction. It is a
          house song with a rhythmical bass and sophisticated beat, and the hook
          that comes in clearly is impressive.<br />
          <br />
          And 'HERO', the first self-composed song by ONEUS RAVN, is a song that
          expresses the dream of anyone dreaming of becoming a hero or a hero.
          It's a song.<br />
          <br />
          The last b-side song, 'ㅁChehehe (prod. CyA)', was produced by CyA, a
          member who is in charge of the bass and rap of ONEWE, a brother team
          of ONEUS. It is a song that is expressed as 'crazy'. The desire to be
          the best was captured in trap hip hop with individual SWAGs of RAVN,
          Ido, and CyA. CyA participated in the hook and bass to improve the
          quality of the song.
