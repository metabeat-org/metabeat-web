        <h2>Feature</h2>
        <p id="desc">
          MAMAMOO released their 6th mini-album "Yellow Flower" in March and
          successfully finished their promotions. Amid active individual
          activities featuring hidden charms and capabilities, as predicted in a
          year when Mamamoo's music and talent bloom, Moon Byul's solo album
          release has also been reported for the first time in 4 years since her
          debut.<br />
          <br />
          Moon Byul, who has shown endless musical development in recognition of
          her powerful rap skills as well as performance and sensible rap making
          through Mamamoo's activities, came to fans as a multi-musician by
          showing stable vocal skills through this album. For the first solo
          album [SELFISH] she worked with her best-friend producer Park
          Woo-sang, who worked outstandingly with Mamamoo, and Moon Byul also
          actively participated in making the album, including the writing of
          the lyrics and singing in the chorus.<br />
          <br />
          In the music video for the song [SELFISH], in which song title is the
          same as the album title, the cute SWAG full of clumsiness is shown,
          and the lovely Moonbyul looks as she is wearing perfect-fitting
          clothes. In particular, Red Velvet's Seulgi, who continues to have a
          warm friendship after working together in 'Idol Drama Operation Team',
          featured in the music video, making a special collaboration between
          trending idols Moonbyul and Seulgi, Raising fans' expectations to the
          peak. With a beautiful voice from one of the best girl groups,
          Moonbyul, a talented rapper, and Seulgi, the SM tone fairy, their
          collaboration is something that is that is amazing to listen to. The
          [In my room] and [Acoustic Ver.], unlike the bright and refreshing
          title song, shows the charm with lyrics that contains serious stories
          deep inside Moonbyul.
