          The one word that is spit out from the wounds that pile up like fallen
          leaves, “Let's break up”<br />
          <br />
          - 'Voice Fairy' Wheein's solo album [soar] is released, who has
          returned full of autumn emotions!<br />
          - Second collaboration with emotional producer 'Junkey' following
          &lt;Becoming a Burden&gt;!<br />
          <br />
          Wheein, who has been loved by the public for her unique voice, is back
          with her second solo album [soar].<br />
          <br />
          This album [soar], which is an extension of Wheein's first solo album
          [magnolia], captures the beautiful but sad image of the petals flying
          in the wind when the magnolia blooms and falls again. This is an
          attractive album where you can feel Wheein's delicate and deep
          musicality.<br />
          <br />
          The title song &lt;Let's Break Up&gt; is the second song that I
          collaborated with emotional producer 'Junkey', and the emotion of a
          person who had no choice but to say goodbye after a lot of trouble was
          melted into a soft piano melody and Wheein's delicate yet hard vocals,
          which were buried deep in memory. even stimulate emotions.<br />
          <br />
          The music video for &lt;Let's Break Up&gt;, produced as a drama
          tights, unfolded the story by focusing on the sad lyrics. Song
          Chae-yeon's delicate acting expresses the complex and subtle feelings
          that made her fall in love with an art teacher. Wheein's sorrowful
          singing appearance in the music video stimulates the viewer's emotions
          and makes them immerse themselves in the story even more deeply.<br />
          <br />
          Wheein worked with the album as a whole and melted her artistry into
          the album. From painting works that can be seen in music videos and
          jacket photos to styling of clothes, she was confident enough that
          there was no place that Wheein could not reach. It captured the
          thoughts of<br />
          <br />
          Wheein's second solo album to fly higher [soar]<br />
          Expectations are high for a luxury ballad that will stimulate deep
          emotions this fall with a single word from faded love, &lt;Let's break
          up&gt;.<br />
