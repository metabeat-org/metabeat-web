          MAMAMOO's "Four Seasons Four Color Project"'s second album [RED
          MOON]<br />
          <br />
          - Comeback with "Summer Mammu" that will make the hot summer even
          hotter!<br />
          - Mamamoo's colorful and passionate charm that will color this summer
          with "RED"!<br />
          - Mamamoo returns as a whole with [RED MOON].<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Mamamoo started the successful voyage of the 'Four Seasons Four Color
          Project' by sweeping various charts through the title song &lt;Starry
          Night&gt; of [Yellow Flower] in March of this year. The new mini-album
          [RED MOON], featuring Moonbyul's 'RED', was released for the second
          time in this project that captures the hidden charms and capabilities
          of each member that have not been shown before with each symbol in
          four colors. [RED MOON] is a combination of Mamamoo's second color,
          red, and Moon, meaning Moonbyul, and is expected to heat up the hot
          summer by pouring out Mamamoo's passionate charm that resembles
          summer.<br />
          <br />
          This mini album contains a total of 6 songs. The title song of
          Moonbyul's solo album [SELFISH], including &lt;Rainy Season&gt;, which
          was released as a surprise release as a pre-release on the 8th and
          ranked first in the music chart for the first time in a girl group. is
          included. In addition, it is performed with a minor chord and makes
          one part of the heart cool with the horror atmosphere &lt;Summer
          Night's Dream&gt;, especially &lt;From Today We&gt;, &lt;Running
          Through Time&gt;, &lt;You&gt; of the girl group 'Girlfriend'. And I,
          Lee Gi and Yong-bae, who produced 'I', will participate as a new
          member and work on the song 'Sky Sky (Innocent)', showing Mamamoo's
          unique innocence that has been hidden in the past. In addition,
          although it has not been officially released, &lt;Sleep even if it's a
          sleep&gt;, which is loved by fans for its funny lyrics of the
          affectionate (?) Diss members throwing at each other, is officially
          included in this album.<br />
          <br />
          The title song &lt;You and You&gt; is a collaboration between hit
          maker composer Kim Do-hoon, who is the general producer of Mamamoo's
          album, and Mamamoo's best friend, producer Park Woo-sang, making it
          possible to expect the birth of eight consecutive hit songs. This
          intense and hot song that evokes the image of a passionate summer is
          like a cider-like song that gives a hint to a lover who is selfish and
          takes care of himself first. In particular, as Mamamoo has gained the
          sympathy of women with music that represents the candid and dignified
          image of a woman, this new song &lt;You Me&gt; will once again show
          off her girl-crush charm. The music video for this title song was
          filmed in an exotic setting that is as good as an overseas location.
          It was a studio in Korea, but it is an interesting situation where
          there are still different opinions among fans about where the filming
          location is. If in the last &lt;Starry Night&gt;, a natural, innocent,
          elegant and mysterious alluring beauty was produced, in the music
          video for &lt;You and Me&gt;, the more intense and hotter and more
          provocative South American charm in the passionate 'RED' catches the
          eye.<br />
          <br />
          Mamamoo is showing each and every one of her charms that have deepened
          through the 'Four Seasons Four Color Project'.<br />
          We are looking forward to the upcoming seasons with Mamamoo.
