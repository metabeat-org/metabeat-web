          ONEUS, depicting the time of dawn and sunset [RAISE US]<br />
          The second story of the 'US' series, 'The Sun is Falling'<br />
          <br />
          RBW's rookie boy group ONEUS releases the second mini-album [RAISE US]
          of the 'US' series.<br />
          <br />
          Consisting of RAVN, Seoho, Leedo, Keonhee, Hwanwoong, and Xion, ONEUS
          took their first steps in the music industry with their debut album
          'LIGHT US' in January. Upon the release of their debut album, they
          topped the iTunes K-pop album charts in 4 countries, garnering
          attention from around the world and establishing themselves as
          next-generation K-pop prospects.<br />
          <br />
          This mini-album [RAISE US] is an album with the meaning of “lifting us
          up.” If the last debut album, 'LIGHT US,'' meant “ONEUS, born with the
          light people shine on, the music they make,” , This album contains the
          meaning of “ONEUS, which will take a higher leap with the light that
          people shine on.”<br />
          <br />
          In addition, [RAISE US] has the theme of the time before sunrise, when
          the darkness has not yet completely gone, and around sunset, just
          before it gets dark in earnest. It refers to countless times, and the
          motif was taken from a French proverb, 'the time between dogs and
          wolves'. It is an album with a concept of the contrasting duality as a
          keyword, with the theme of the red hour of sunset when the sun goes
          down and the blue hour of dawn when the sun rises.<br />
          <br />
          The title song 'Twilight' is a song that expresses the concept of this
          album, 'the time between dogs and wolves (when the sun goes down)',
          and top producer Kim Do-hoon participated in the composition. A more
          complete song was created by adding impressive lyrics that compared
          the falling sun to a lover breaking up along with a delicate yet
          intense sound.<br />
          <br />
          The music video for 'Twilight' was directed by Johnny Bros Hong
          Won-ki, based on the album's concept and the song's lyrics, and was
          all filmed in Italy. It created a visual beauty. The time of waiting
          and longing for a lover who left her side at dawn, and the time of
          regret at the moment the sun goes dark were captured in a vague yet
          intense video.<br />
          <br />
          In particular, world-renowned choreographer 'Keone Madrid'
          participated in the choreography of the title song, further maximizing
          the performance of 'Twilight'.<br />
          <br />
          In addition, the [RAISE US] album includes the title song 'Twilight',
          'Intro: Time', 'English Girl', 'Time Between Dog and Wolf (BingBing)',
          'White Night' (White Night) It is expected that this album will also
          show off the colorful charms of ONEUS, with a total of 6 b-side songs
          including 'Night' and 'Now'.
