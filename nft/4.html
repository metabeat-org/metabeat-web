          Mamamoo's 3rd album [BLUE;S], "Four Seasons, Four Colors Project" has
          been released<br />
          <br />
          - The comeback of 'Sentimental Mammu', which embraces the lonely and
          vaguely autumn!<br />
          - Sniping the emotions of autumn with the unique charm of Sentimental
          Mamamoo!<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Mamamoo, who announced the start of the 'Four Seasons Four Color
          Project' in March 2018. The project's first album [Yellow Flower]'s
          title song &lt;Starry Night&gt; swept the top spots on various music
          sites, followed by the second [RED MOON]'s title song &lt;You and
          Me&gt;, not only in Korea, but also on Billboard. The group has
          successfully completed their activities, receiving a lot of love to
          the point where they ranked at the top of overseas charts, including .
          And now that I want to hold on to the passing autumn a little more, I
          come back with the [BLUE;S] album that will soothe listeners' regret
          and moisten their emotions.<br />
          <br />
          The third project album was completed as [BLUE;S] by adding the member
          Solar's color 'BLUE' and 'S' from SOLAR. Blue is often thought of
          first as a symbol of freedom and hope, but this album contains the
          cold and quiet sadness and melancholy behind it.<br />
          <br />
          The title song &lt;Wind flower&gt; is a song that shows Mamamoo's
          album general producer and unrivaled hit composer Kim Do-hoon and
          Mamamoo's best friend producer Park Woo-sang once again showing
          fantastic breathing. 'Wind flower (anemone)' in flower language means
          'sad feelings after parting'. Among the many emotions felt after
          parting with a loved one, the song is about the will to overcome the
          painful heart with lyrics that seem to blow away even the memories of
          being together with the wind.<br />
          <br />
          [BLUE;S] starts with the seasonally tailored &lt;Autumn to Winter&gt;
          following the intro &lt;Winter to Spring&gt; from the previous [Yellow
          Flower] album, and the impressive melody full of tension and Mamamoo's
          powerful vocals are like one piece. < No more drama >, reminiscent of
          a drama, and &lt;HELLO&gt;, a self-composed song as it is an album of
          'Solar'. In addition, &lt;Better than I thought&gt;, which calmly
          talks about parting with a lover, and &lt;Morning&gt;, which expresses
          the sadness of waking up alone in the morning by melting it into a
          calm and warm string sound, are emotional and glossy that match the
          name of the album. It was filled with mood songs.<br />
          <br />
          In the music video for &lt; Wind flower &gt;, the members are
          sometimes sad, sometimes dancing and singing in a seemingly innocent
          way, expressing the aftereffects of a breakup. Like the various flower
          words about breakup in 'wind flower', each member takes charge and
          expresses the complex emotions that one person faces while going
          through a breakup, the memories filled with regrets and regrets, and
          the complex emotions that one overcomes after a chaotic conflict.
          Unraveled in the city of images. Although we are walking through the
          colorful night streets of Hong Kong, the unavoidable loneliness that
          glistens through our eyes makes even the viewer sad.<br />
          <br />
          [BLUE;S] that captures the atmosphere of late autumn to its fullest<br />
          We are looking forward to Mamamoo's warm temperature that will soothe
          the lonely and cold heart in the chilly weather.<br />
