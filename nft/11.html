        <h2>Feature</h2>
        <p id="desc">
          "MAMAMOO, who received a lot of love with their mini album [Yellow
          Flower] in March." Then, while raising fans' expectations by
          announcing the release of the album on July 16, the song "Rainy
          Season" was released in advance.<br />
          <br />
          It is a sweet medium R&B song that highlights the attractive tones of
          each member soaked in the moist electric guitar riff, and it will
          comfort the melancholy that leaks out on a rainy day like today,
          tickling the quiet and quiet tears.<br />
          <br />
          I can trap my sadness in the falling rain, but the gray clouds that
          fill the sky are cold.<br />
          <br />
          The pain of parting pours out immeasurably and it doesn't go away
          until quite a while.<br />
          Like a rainy season."
