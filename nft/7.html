        <h2>Feature</h2>
        <p id="desc">
          The special single &lt;Everyday&gt; is a song by Cosmic Sound that
          worked on Mamamoo's 'Emotion', 'A Good Day', and 'Rude Boy'. It is a
          tropical house genre with a refreshing feel. Before the addictive hook
          comes out, adding a light twist to the song unfolded without being
          boring, it boasts the chemistry of Mamamoo x Cosmic Sound once again.
          In particular, the lyrics, 'Why am I so excited about what to do
          today, I just look in the mirror with a pounding heart', which
          directly expresses the tickling and trembling heart, and garners
          strong sympathy from everyone who is riding. It is undoubtedly a cool
          and lovely song like the spring breeze, with the talented idol
          Mamamoo's singing ability added to the cute lyrics of confessing that
          we'll see each other every day instead of saying we'll date each other
          because we can't hide our overwhelming heart just by looking at it.<br />
          <br />
          Now, let's end our thumbs up and confess our &lt;Everyday&gt; and walk
          along the cherry blossom streets of spring with the person you love.
