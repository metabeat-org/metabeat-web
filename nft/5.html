          Feeling a hit this time? Mamamoo's buzzword vending machine [If you
          think I'd speak it]<br />
          If you think you can speak Mamamoo?? Infinite charm that is not enough
          with one modifier<br />
          <br />
          Mamamoo, who has transformed into a cute bravado that is not hateful,
          is back with the 5th mini album [Purple].<br />
          <br />
          This fifth mini-album titled [Purple] is a color with unusual creative
          meaning. It is also a color that can express Mamamoo's unique
          personality, which cannot be overlooked as a difficult color name that
          cannot be easily digested by anyone. In addition, Mamamoo's unique
          color 'Purple' was completed by adding the provocative and
          unpredictable blue charm to the fresh and lively pink charm of the 3rd
          mini album title song 'Um Oh Ah Ye'. It can be said that it is an
          album that fully captures the colorful and colorful charms of Mamamoo.
