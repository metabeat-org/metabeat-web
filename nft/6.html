        <h2>Feature</h2>
        <p id="desc">
          Mamamoo's new song "Paint Me", released for the first time in the new
          year, song written by 5 producers including Peter Wallevik, who worked
          with famous foreign artists such as Little Mix, Olly Murs, Kylie
          Minogue, One Direction, and Demi Lovato. Despite the restrained
          session composition with picturesque lyrics that metaphorically
          express the excitement and warmth of love, the cold pain of parting,
          and the passionate emotions that become hot again in four colors:
          white, yellow, blue, and red. The rich ambience, the melody of the
          main piano that holds the center of the song, the guitar sound that
          continues to give tension to the song, and the strings in the second
          half add to the music of a grand scale reminiscent of a blockbuster
          movie OST. In addition, vocals that express the emotions of each
          member in their own way were added to increase the concentration of
          the song. In particular, 'Moon Byul', well known for her rap position
          in 'Mamamoo', through this song, transformed into a vocalist and sang
          with a mournful voice, boldly showing off her hidden vocal skills,
          exuding charm.
