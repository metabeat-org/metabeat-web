          [White Wind] Marking of the end of Mamamoo's 'Four Seasons Four Color
          Project' has been release!<br />
          <br />
          - Mamamoo's 'CHILL' in white party time!<br />
          - Four people, four colors, unique concept digestibility 'I'm going
          crazy'<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Mamamoo, who announced the start of the 'Four Seasons Four Color
          Project' last spring and successfully opened the door with their first
          album [Yellow Flower], followed by [RED MOON] and [BLUE;S], receiving
          great love both in Korea and abroad. Mamamoogi, which drew trends and
          issues with unique performances and point choreography in each album,
          and made a big impact on various music sites and performing arts,
          always comes with the modifier 'trust and listen'.<br />
          <br />
          It's March again, when the spring vibes are gently felt. Mamamoo came
          with [White Wind] to mark the end of the 'Four Seasons Four Color
          Project'.<br />
          <br />
          [White Wind], the ninth mini album and the last album of the 'Four
          Seasons Four Color Project', was completed by adding 'white', the
          symbol color of Wheein, and 'wind' following the flowers, stars and
          sun, which are the symbols of each member. The album title [White
          Wind], which goes well with Wheein's clean and pure image, contains
          the history of Mamamoo's first meeting until now on a white canvas. In
          particular, the debut song in Mamamoo's group concept photo, which was
          released for the first time. The color and composition of the movie
          were reproduced as it is, giving fans memories.<br />
          <br />
          [White Wind]'s title song &lt;gogobebe&gt; was composed by general
          producer Kim Do-hoon, who always creates new concepts for Mamamoo. A
          cheerful Mamamoo who is not obsessed with past love and events, and is
          enjoying it by using the lyrics and melody of the song 'Gigi Bebe
          Crying Birds. can meet<br />
          <br />
          The music video for the title song &lt;gogobebe&gt; begins in a
          chaotic place as if it had been a mad night. The members, who were
          tired of boring and boring daily life, receive an invitation to a
          house party and start preparing to go to the party with a pleasant
          imagination. Make shopping a lot, and make the dress code bling bling.
          However, the party venue that went into the wrong place due to the
          pranks of the local kids is a book club with an old-fashioned
          atmosphere! However, the embarrassment is short-lived, and Mamamoo
          turns even that place into a party room with their own energy.<br />
          <br />
          When the first music video teaser was released, it was nicknamed 'Song
          of Fellowship' from fans, raising expectations. Mamamoo's unique
          concept digestibility is also expected to prove once again through
          &lt;gogobebe&gt;.<br />
          <br />
          &lt;Where RU&gt;, a song about the thrill of waiting for a fateful
          lover like a hide-and-seek, and &lt;Waggy&gt;, which impresses with
          the humorous and witty lyrics of the bossa nova style, are full of
          charm like a lovely and cute spring breeze. As it is a Wheein concept
          album, &lt;25 (Solo Wheein)&gt;, who participated in writing the
          lyrics, captures the worries and emotions of 25-year-old Wheein. It
          will be of deep sympathy and comfort to those who are living at this
          age. It is a POP R&B genre that desperately expresses the painful
          feelings of not being able to accept the approaching parting easily.
          was included as the only parting song on this album. Expressing a
          person who cannot be compared with any existence by comparing them to
          'my own star' is a powerful and attractive song with a magnificent and
          aggressive melody line.<br />
          <br />
          In particular, in this album, &lt;4season&gt; was recorded as an
          outro, not an intro like [Yellow Flower]'s &lt;Winter to Spring&gt;
          and [BLUE;S]'s &lt;Autumn to Winter&gt;. The song that encompasses the
          'Four Seasons Four Color Project' reminds us of the happy four
          seasons, and [White Wind] contains the meaning of wishing that the new
          seasons that will come again are also included.<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Yellow, Red, Blue and then White again.<br />
          I look forward to the future colors that will be brilliantly painted
          on a dazzlingly white canvas.
