          Mamamoo's 6th mini album [Yellow Flower] release<br />
          <br />
          Mamamoo is releasing a mini album [Yellow Flower] that will color this
          spring with their own brilliance.<br />
          <br />
          The album name of the album [Yellow Flower] is a combination of the
          member Hwasa's color 'yellow' and 'flower', which means a flower named
          after Hwasa. As yellow symbolizes spring and a new start, it is an
          album where Mamamoo's music and talents, which are making their first
          start in 2018, blossom.<br />
          <br />
          This mini album contains a total of 7 songs. In particular, in this
          album, Mamamoo's leader Solar's self-composed song 'Star Wind Flower
          Sun' is included as a sub-title song. Before the release, the song was
          released as a teaser video to express gratitude to the fans on Solar's
          birthday, drawing great attention.<br />
          <br />
          In addition, the intro titled 'From Winter to Spring', the title song
          'Starry Night', the solo song 'Becoming Dumb' with the candid and
          honest lyrics of Hwasa, the main character of this album's color, and
          the storytelling lyrics of fishery management are attractive. It
          contains 'Rude Boy', 'Bomta' with a sweet acoustic sound, and 'Paint
          Me', which was released as a single in January.
