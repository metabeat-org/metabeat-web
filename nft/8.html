        <h2>Feature</h2>
        <p id="desc">
          Its definitely hard not to pick Hwa Sa as the female artist who has
          been in the center of the attention since 2018, by sweeping the top
          brand reputation. Hwa sa, who has been loved for her friendly
          appearance as a friendly celebrity in TV entertainment shows, is now
          challenging herself by starting her first solo album since her debut
          as part of the group Mamamoo.<br />
          <br />
          Hwasa, who actively participated in music work such as writing,
          composing, and editing in Mamamoo's album and showed her own color,
          took a step further in her career as a solo musician with overwhelming
          charm by working in detail together with the makers of this album.<br />
          <br />
          Hwa Sa's solo debut song, "Twit," which was made by hitmaker producer
          Kim Do-hoon and composer Park Woo-sang, attracts listeners' eyes and
          ears with its high-quality charm that is dreamy and mysterious rather
          than the existing sexy or friendly appearance. With Hwa Sa's addictive
          melody and charming signature voice, she showed restrained charisma
          and gave off unrivaled aura.<br />
          <br />
          [Twit] is a song that shows the loneliness felt by realizing it is
          inevitable for the lover who only looks at and suffercates. And this
          is expressed as "twit twit".<br />
          <br />
          The music video "Twit," was directed by director Hong Won-Ki of Johnny
          Bros, which is filled with Hwa Sa's elegance and confidence, which is
          fashionable and impactful as if looking at a magazine. In particular,
          the costumes in the unique music video even provides the pleasure by
          just watching, and in order to build Hwa Sa's unique style, she has
          participated steadily from the planning stage and put her heart and
          soul into it.<br />
          <br />
          Looking forward to 'Hwa Sa Syndrome' once again through [twit] that
          will unleash the latent potential.
